# Simple-Linear-Regression

Simple Linear Regression is a type of Regression algorithms that models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. The relationship shown by a Simple Linear Regression model is linear or a sloped straight line, hence it is called Simple Linear Regression.

The key point in Simple Linear Regression is that the dependent variable must be a continuous/real value. However, the independent variable can be measured on continuous or categorical values.

Simple Linear regression algorithm has mainly two objectives:
- Model the relationship between the two variables. Such as the relationship between Income and expenditure, experience and Salary, etc.
- Forecasting new observations. Such as Weather forecasting according to temperature, Revenue of a company according to the investments in a year, etc.


## Implementation 
- Importing the required libraries.
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the data.
- Checking the correlation between the dependent and independent variables.
- Fitting the Simple Linear Regression Model using Ordinary Least Squares(OLS) method.
- Applying Transformations(Log, Square root, Cube root, Exponential, Quadratic) to the data.
- Finding the best fit model using R-squared.
- Prediction of the dependent variable using the independent variable.
